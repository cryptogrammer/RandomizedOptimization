## Analysis of Randomized Optimization Techniques

Instructions for running the code

The code is based off of the ABAGAIL code. The code was written and run in the eclipse IDE.

For the dataset, simply run myTest.java. It will run on the provided dataset and produce the output to a file called newResults.txt. This file is located in src/opt/test.

For the optimization problems, the code was modified a bit. Run the TravelingSalesmanTest.java, ContinuousPeaks.java and KnapsackTest.java and they will produce the required output. These files are located in src/opt/test.
